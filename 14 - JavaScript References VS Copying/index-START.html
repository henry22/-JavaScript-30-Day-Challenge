    let str1 = 'hello';
    let str2 = str1;
    console.log(str1, str2);

    str2 = 'world';
    console.log(str1, str2);

    let num1 = 1;
    let num2 = num1;
    console.log(num1, num2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team1 = players;
    console.log(players, team1);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team1[2] = 'Henry';
    // console.log(players, team1);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2] = 'Henry';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'Henry';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[2] = 'Henry';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[2] = 'Henry';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 30
    };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person1 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Henry', age: 20 });
    console.log(person, person1);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    person2.name = 'John';
    person2.age = 50;
    console.log(person, person2);
